 The bulk of my undergraduate laboratory life at Cornell was spent in the <a ccID="508" href="https://www.classe.cornell.edu/~ib38/">Bazarov lab</a>, working with <a ccID="586" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IiKkItoAAAAJ&hl=en">Luca Cultrera</a> on a variety of projects and being a general wrench monkey when necessary.

 <h2 ccID="762"> What is a Photocathode? </h2>
 
 <p ccID="802">
 A variety of applications, ranging from accelerator physics to medical scans, require a highly collimated electron beam. These beams are produced via the photoelectric effect, by shining a light on a semiconductor surface which releases The materials studied in the <a ccID="1074" href="https://www.classe.cornell.edu/~ib38/">Bazarov lab</a> were mainly alkali antimonides and related compounds, e.g. Na<sub ccID="1199">2</sub>KSb, Cs<sub ccID="1218">3</sub>Sb, and Cs<sub ccID="1240">2</sub>Te. These are semiconductors which emit electrons when illuminated with light in the visible spectrum. Alkali antimonides are unstable in the presence of air and water, and so must be grown, stored, and analyzed under ultra high vacuum (UHV), generally at or below 10<sup ccID="1519">-10</sup> Torr.

 A good photocathode has a two important qualities: high quantum efficiency and low mean transverse energy. The quantum efficiency (QE) is a measure of how many photons are needed to excite an electron. The mean transverse energy (MTE) is a measure of the momentum spread of the electron beam, a quantity which is corrected for with bunchers and solenoids in the beamline but is important to get right at the material level. In general, it's difficult to simultaneously minimize MTE and maximize QE at visible wavelengths, so typically MTE would take precedence.

 Our lab occupied roughly half of Newman Laboratory, including an office, according to Peter Lepage, where Ken Wilson came up with his theory of renormalization. Some of our facilities included two growth chambers utilizing chemical vapor deposition (CVD), an Auger spectrometer, a Mott polarimeter, and a custom-made setup for measuring MTE (termed the TEMeter, pronounced "tee-ee-meter"). Future installments will include a cryogenically cooled TEMeter and a beamline with a 50 Watt (!) laser as a tunable IR to UV light source.

 <h2 ccID="2755"> The Baby </h2>
 
 <p ccID="2780">
 One tool lacking from that list is something to measure surface roughness. Through a collaboration with Melissa Hines in the chemistry department, we got access to a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) in Baker Lab, which was inconveniently a parking lot away from Newman Labs where the cathodes were grown. To add to the complications, under normal operating circumstances, the STM would be opened under atmosphere, the sample would be inserted, and the system would be pumped down, a procedure which would compromise our photocathodes. We therefore had to design a vacuum "suitcase" to transport cathodes under UHV from Newman Lab to Baker Lab, along with a manipulator and gate valve system to get the sample inside under vacuum.

 While optical measurements may have sufficed to get an estimate of surface roughness This "suitcase" was capable of transporting a sample under a vacuum of 10<sup ccID="3695">-10</sup> Torr. The Baby was adapted for transporting samples grown under chemical vapor deposition to a scanning tunnel microscope (STM)

 While the Baby was being birthed, it was important to come up with a technique to noninvasively measure the roughness of the photocathodes. Due to a formula by Davies [1] and as summarized by Bennett and Porteus [2], there is a precise relationship between RMS roughness and specular reflectance given by $$\sigma = \frac{\lambda}{4 \pi \cos \theta} \sqrt{ - \ln \left( \frac{R}{R_0} \right)}$$ for specular reflectance \(R\) With this relation, we were able to verify measurements of surface roughness taken with a profilometer with only a few lenses and a power meter.
