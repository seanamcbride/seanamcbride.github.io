 <h2> Ingredients </h2>
 <ul>
 <li> 3/4 stick of butter (6 Tbsp/3 oz) </li>
 <li> 1/3 cup milk </li>
 <li> 1/2 cup of sugar </li>
 <li> 2 eggs, beaten </li>
 <li> 4 ripe bananas </li>
 <li> 2 cups whole wheat flour </li>
 <li> 1 tsp kosher salt </li>
 <li> 1 tsp baking soda </li>
 
 </ul>
 
 <h2> Instructions </h2>
 <p>
 Add sugar and milk to melted butter. Add two beaten eggs, making sure the butter isn't hot enough to cook the eggs. Mash bananas and combine with the butter-sugar-milk-egg mixture. Mix in remaining dry ingredients. Bake in parchment-lined loaf pan for 60 minutes at 325Â°F. Let cool in the pan for a few minutes before removing and letting cool on a cooling rack.

This is the first thing I ever cooked with my mom and brother, so it's earned a special place in my baking heart, despite how simple it is. I like eating this cold from the fridge like a fruit cake, but it's also good served warm with salted maple butter.

You could optionally use all-purpose flour and nix some of the banana for more sugar and butter if you want a more bready texture, but I like it dense and extra banana-y. Other fun changes are swapping some of the sugar for an equal amount of maple syrup, adding dark brown sugar or molasses for a more pronounced bitterness, and flavoring with some warm winter spices, but to me these are more appropriate for a pumpkin quickbread (where you substitute the bananas for a can of pureed pumpkin).
